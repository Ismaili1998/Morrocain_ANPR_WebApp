# Morrocain_ANPR_WebApp
License plate standards vary from country to country. Therefore, the ANPR systems currently used are country-specific, for this reason, a particular need for this technology is noticed for countries having special characters on their license plates, as in Morocco, where the Arabic alphabet is used to identify license plates. In this project we propose an ANP WEB-APP in a Moroccan context, allowing real-time recognition of Moroccan license plates.
